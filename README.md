# Webserv

## Overview

Welcome to Webserv, an HTTP server project where we've implemented our very own HTTP server. This server is capable of serving static websites, handling HTTP methods, supporting file uploads, and more. Understanding the intricacies of the HTTP protocol is essential, even if you're not planning to become a web developer.
